<h2>Model fitting</h2>
<p>Genewise negative binomial generalized linear models were using the
<code>glmFit()</code> function of the <code>edgeR</code> package.
Likelihood ratio tests were then performed for the coefficients in the
model with <code>glmLRT()</code>. Here the null hypothesis, <span
class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, is testing that the true values of
the coefficients are equal to 0. Due to the subtle effects of the
mutation outlined in the PCA, genes were considered to be DE if they had
an FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, as opposed to more stringent error
rate controls such as the Bonferroni method.</p>

<h1>Conditional Quantile Normalisation</h1>
<p>Conditional Quantile Normalisation (CQN) is a procedure that can
account for GC content and length biases in differential expression and
is implemented with package <code>cqn</code>. It does this by making by
calculating offset values that can be incorporated into the GLM. Both GC
content and length were noted as being of concern and were therefore
used to calculate offsets. The resulting <code>glm.offset</code> values
