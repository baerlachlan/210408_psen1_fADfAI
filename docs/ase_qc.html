<h2>Trimmed data</h2>
<p>Trimming software was setup carefully with the intention to perform downstream detection of short variants following the <code>GATK</code> workflow. Part of this process involves the removal of duplicate reads which relies on detection of duplicates by comparing sequences in the 5’ positions. Trimming can therefore be detrimental to downstream analysis. As such, the trimming procedure was performed more so as a filtering step, where reads were discarded if:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>40% of the bases did not meet the threshold of a 20 phred quality score.</li>
<li>reads were shorter than 35 base pairs in length.</li>

<h2>Duplicates</h2>
<p>Marking duplicates is important because almost all statistical models for variant calling assume some sort of independence between measurements. Duplicates that arise from PCR artifacts are not independent. Aligned reads were classified into duplicate groups based on their genomic coordinates and UMI sequence. This was performed with <code>UMI-tools group</code>, which tagged duplicate groups in the <code>BAM</code> file with the same <code>BX</code> tags. <code>Picard MarkDuplicates</code> was used to mark duplicates assigned to groups with the <code>--BARCODE_TAG</code> option. <code>MarkDuplicates</code> was set up to select the representative read for each group at random, as opposed to a base quality scoring strategy, such that reference allele mapping bias was avoided for downstream Allele Specific Expression (ASE) testing.</p>

<div id="base-quality-score-recalibration" class="section level2">
<h2>Base quality score recalibration</h2>
<p>Base quality score recalibration (BQSR) is a recommended technique in the <code>GATK</code> workflow which is used to assign accurate confidence scores to each sequenced base. Real data contains systematic biases due to artifacts of sample preparation, sequencing and mapping. BQSR aims to correct for the range of these types of artifacts, as downstream tools rely on base qualities to weigh the variant calls they make. The process involves two keys steps performed by tools <code>BaseRecalibrator</code> and <code>ApplyBQSR</code> in the <code>GATK</code> suite.</p>
<p><strong>BaseRecalibrator</strong></p>
<p><code>BaseRecalibrator</code> builds a model of covariation based on the input data and a set of known variants. Since this dataset originates from zebrafish which are highly polymorphic, the set of known variants was generated directly from the data as opposed to obtaining it from an online database. Details about this procedure are described <a href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035890531-Base-Quality-Score-Recalibration-BQSR-">here</a>. <code>BaseRecalibrator</code> records data about the following features of aligned bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read group</li>
<li>Quality score</li>
<li>Machine cycle producing the base (Nth cycle = Nth base from the start of the read)</li>
<li>Dinucleotide context (current base + previous base)</li>
</ul>
<p>For each bin, the number of bases and how often such bases mistmatch the reference are counted and exported as a recalibration report.</p>
<p><strong>ApplyBQSR</strong></p>
<p><code>ApplyBQSR</code> uses the recalibration file to go through the reads and adjust each base’s score depending on what bins it falls in. The new quality score is effectively determined by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sum of the global difference between reported quality scores and the empirical quality</li>
<li>plus the quality bin specific shift</li>
<li>plus the cycle x quality and dinucleotide x quality effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Recalibration should cause the read quality scores to match their empirical scores much closer than before. This allows for more statistically robust downstream variant calling.</p>

<h2>Genomic location</h2>
<p>Variants were restricted to those that lie only in exonic regions of the Ensembl version 101 primary assembly. For zebrafish this consists of chromosomes 1 to 25. To perform this inside of <code>GATK</code>’s variant calling <code>HaploypeCaller</code> command, an interval list was created containing the exonic ranges. A number of interval list formats are supported by GATK as described <a href="https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360035531852-Intervals-and-interval-lists">here</a>. The GATK-style <code>.intervals</code> is poorly described but requires the format <code>&lt;chr&gt;:&lt;start&gt;-&lt;end&gt;</code> e.g. <code>1:1367-1367</code> for a singular base position. The nomenclature must match that of the chosen reference, for example, Ensembl labels chromosome 1 as “1”, not “chr1”. The GATK-style format was chosen for its simplicity.</p>
<p>Defining intervals before calling variants also has the advantage of a large speed-up in computational processing time. <code>HaplotypeCaller</code> is the longest step in the <code>GATK</code> short variant discovery pipeline, sometimes taking over a day to process for large datasets on a HPC system when interval lists are not utilised.</p>

Variants were removed with the following filters:</p>
<ul>
<li>QualByDepth: QD &lt; 2.0
<ul>
<li>Variant confidence (QUAL field) divided by the unfiltered depth of non-homozygous reference samples. Removing variants that have a low QD normalises the variant quality and avoids inflation caused by deep coverage.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>FisherStrand: FS &gt; 60.0
<ul>
<li>The Phred-scaled probability there there is strand bias at the site. Strand bias indicates whether the alternate allele was seen more or less often on the forward or reverse strand than the reference allele. When there is little to no strand bias at the site, the FS value is close to 0.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>StrandOddsRatio: SOR &gt; 4.0
<ul>
<li>An alternative way to estimate strand bias using a test similar to the symmetric odds ratio test.</li>

<li>RMSMappingQuality: MQ &lt; 40.0
<ul>
<li>Root mean square mapping quality over all the reads at the site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MappingQualityRankSumTest: MQRankSum &lt; -12.5
<ul>
<li>u-based z-approximation from the Rank Sum Test for mapping qualities. This compares the mapping qualities of the reads supporting the reference allele and the alternate allele.</li>

<h3>WASP</h3>
<p>An important aspect to consider in ASE analysis is the potential for read mapping bias. For RNA-seq data mapped to a reference genome, reads that carry an alternate allele at positions of variation have at least one mismatch, and therefore a lower probability of aligning correctly than reads containing the reference allele.</p>
<p><code>WASP</code> provides a suite of tools for unbiased allele-specific read mapping. The <code>WASP</code> workflow for mappability filtering is defined by 5 steps:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reads are mapped normally with the user’s mapper of choice (<code>STAR</code> was chosen in this case).</li>
<li>Reads that overlap identified SNVs and therefore may have mapping bias are determined using <code>find_intersecting_snps.py</code> script. Each overlapping read is output as a set of synthetic reads in <code>FASTQ</code> format with its allele swapped to to the other allele at the SNV site.</li>
<li>The set of allele-swapped reads are re-mapped using the same method and options used in step 1.</li>
<li>Reads where one or more allelic versions fail to map back to the same location are removed using <code>filter_remapped_reads.py</code> script.</li>
<li>Reads that did not overlap SNVs are merged with those that show unbiased mapping from step 4 using <code>samtools</code>, resulting in a complete set of mappability-filtered aligned reads in <code>BAM</code> format.</li>
</ol>
<p>To begin the <code>WASP</code> fltering procedure, input files containing genetic variants (SNVs) previously identified by the <code>GATK</code> workflow are needed. Since we do not have phasing information, it is recommended to use text-based format opposed to <code>HDF5</code> for the input files. The text-based input files require three space-delimited columns (position, ref_allele, alt_allele), and one input file per chromosome. The filenames must follow the convention <code>&lt;chr&gt;.snps.txt.gz</code> (e.g <code>1.snps.txt.gz</code> for chromosome 1).</p>

<div id="asereadcounter" class="section level3">
<h3>ASEReadCounter</h3>
<p><code>GATK</code> tool <code>ASEReadCounter</code> calculates allele counts at a set of positions after applying filters specifically tuned for ASE analysis of RNA-seq data. The filters operate on mapping quality, base quality, depth of coverage and overlapping paired reads. Each of these filters can be controlled by command-line arguments. The data in this analysis was generated with the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--min-mapping-quality 10</code></li>
<li><code>--min-base-quality 20</code></li>
<li><code>--count-overlap-reads-handling COUNT_FRAGMENTS_REQUIRE_SAME_BASE</code></li>
<li>Ths option counts all fragments where the base is consistent when mate pairs overlap.</li>
<li><code>--min-depth-of-non-filtered-base -1</code></li>
<li>This argument is disabled, because depth filtering was performed manually (see next section: Coverage).</li>
</ul>
<p><code>ASEReadCounter</code> was run on <code>BAM</code> alignment files that were subject to <code>WASP</code> filtering and also alignment files that had not been <code>WASP</code> filtered, to compare whether the filtering procedure improves any observable reference allele mapping bias. Heterozygous SNVs detected by <code>ASEReadCounter</code> were recorded in separate <code>tsv</code> files for each sample. These were loaded into R as a list of tibbles containing allele count data for ASE analysis.</p>
