<h2>Model fitting</h2>
<p>Genewise negative binomial generalized linear models were using the <code>glmFit()</code> function of the <code>edgeR</code> package.

Here the null hypothesis, <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, is testing that the true values of the coefficients are equal to 0. Due to the subtle effects of the mutation outlined in the PCA, genes were considered to be DE if they had an FDR-adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05, as opposed to more stringent error rate controls such as the Bonferroni method.</p>

<h1>Conditional Quantile Normalisation</h1>
<p>Conditional Quantile Normalisation (CQN) is a procedure that can account for GC content and length biases in differential expression and is implemented with package <code>cqn</code>. It does this by making by calculating offset values that can be incorporated into the GLM. As GC content was noted as being of concern, but length showed no bias, only GC content was used to calculate the offsets. The <code>glm.offset</code> values from the output of <code>cqn</code> were added to the original <code>DGEList</code> object.</p>
